> 1. Wildcard for Showdown, win to lose ratio is 1:2. You should be able to complete 50 races of Showdown per hour when Refuelling by watching passive Ad or 80 races of Showdown per hour when refuelling for 20 Gold Coins. To complete 2 Showdown events, you would need to spend 13-20 hours.
> 2. Wildcard for Live races with swap &#x1F501; &#x1F502; &#x1F503; &#x1F504;, win/lose ratio is 1:1.

> &#x1F34E;Intensive grinding suits for highly organised crew of which most members
> 1. attend each wildcard campaign (>15p)
> 2. know how to quickly refuel

> &#x1F34F;Extensive grinding suits for crew
> 1. hard to agree or act on wildcard time (<10p)
> 2. rely on natural refueling
>
> Crew stat indicates 30% campaign generated more RPs. So here is the priority, **30% -> 70% -> 150%**. If 30% is available, activate 30%, otherwise 70%. 150% is the last choice.
> 
> Wildcard time having generated over 0.5m RPs are 20:00 UTC, 2:00 UTC. Crew stats indicates, &#x1F6AB;crew is not as active as usual between 10:00 Fri - 9:59 Sat UTC and generated less than 0.2m RPs in 70% campaign. Better to skip this period of time.

> **Wildcard is activated by admin, unless authorized by admin.** For mature crew, self-governed would be ideal.
>
> Whoever activated wildcard is expected to generate 50k+RPs to be considered serious use of a wildcard.
>
> **Why do we favour planned wildcard campaigns?**
> Wildcard is supposed to boost RP generation for as many as possible. Crew members are located worldwide. Agreeing on common wildcard time is hard.
> If we activate unplanned wildcard often, most would either come unprepared or miss. 
> But we also expect some authorised wildcard, to find more suitable time, etc. Current 20:00 UTC was found by unplanned wildcards.

> - Collect tokens by expiry time from Daily Bonus, Milestone Prize, Season events (Crew Cup, Token Cup, Service Trial, Prestige Cup)
> - Donate tokens at earliest possible time so that we have wildcard available to activate.
> - Fullfil one wildcard then move to next. Do NOT split donations which delays wildcard campaigns.
> - ~~Only one wildcard campaign per day to avoid tiredness~~
