### How frequently do you play
- [Season Schedule 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsgWgXeBoPMRBNFMbDjJLuDbk90S9DuI_o8sPuSyBmI/htmlview), [Season Schedule 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKkwmLYEPRktXw17auU2egdTSyIu6i1JdWZzMrI3wPk/edit)

|Frequency|what|
|---------|----|
|Once a day|Daily Bonus, Weekly Elite Cup, Token/Crew Cup|

#### Options to refuel
1. Car naturally takes 7m36s to fill 1 fuel pip, 1h16m to fill full tank (10 pips)
2. Instantly fill 10 fuel pips for 20 gold coins
3. It takes 5-60 sec to receive 2 fuel pips by watching 1 **passive** video ad which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip. [A guiide to watching Ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSRRacing2/comments/c4x6hc/a_guide_to_watching_ads/)
