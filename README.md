#### Token & Wildcard strategy

- Collect tokens in time from Daily Bonus (4th day of csr week), Milestone Prize (29th, 27th, 20th, 13th), Crew Cup, Token Cup
- [RP and Wildcard tokens can only be claimed during Crew Cup events](https://www.tumblr.com/csrracingofficial/178448763240/the-player-inbox-explained)
- Fullfil one wildcard then move to next. Do NOT split donations which delays wildcard campaigns.
