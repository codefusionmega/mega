### How frequently do you play
- [Season Schedule 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsgWgXeBoPMRBNFMbDjJLuDbk90S9DuI_o8sPuSyBmI/htmlview), [Season Schedule 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKkwmLYEPRktXw17auU2egdTSyIu6i1JdWZzMrI3wPk/edit)

|Frequency|what|
|---------|----|
|Once a day|&#x1F4D9;Daily Bonus, &#x1F536;Weekly Elite Cup, &#x1F4D8;Season events|
|Every 8 hours|Live Races|
|Every 4 hours|Daily Battles, Bronze Crates|

#### Options to refuel
1. Naturally refueling 1 pip takes 7m36s, 1h16m for full tank (10 pips)
2. Spending 20 gold coins to instantly refuel full tank
3. It takes 5-60 sec to receive 2 fuel pips by watching 1 **passive** video ad which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip. [A guiide to watching Ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSRRacing2/comments/c4x6hc/a_guide_to_watching_ads/)
