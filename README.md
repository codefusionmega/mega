## Goals
1. 25-30 active members
2. 23+ eligible to win 900 races of 'Weekly Elite Cup' for 34 rewards every week
3. 20mil RPs for 29 milestone prizes including milestone car every season

### Busyman's minimum playbook
1. Win 40 races of 'Weekly Elite Cup' (10:00 UTC Mon, 0:00 UTC Tue-Fri)
2. Collect and donate 400+ tokens
3. Complete 'Prestige Cup'

### How frequently do you play
- [Season Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsgWgXeBoPMRBNFMbDjJLuDbk90S9DuI_o8sPuSyBmI/htmlview)

|Frequency|what|
|---------|----|
|Once a day|Daily Bonus, Weekly Elite Cup, Token/Crew Cup|
|Every 8 hours|Live Races|
|Every 4 hours|Daily Battles, Bronze Crates|

#### Options to refuel
1. Car naturally takes 7m36s to fill 1 fuel pip, 1h16m to fill full tank (10 pips)
2. Instantly fill 10 fuel pips for 20 gold coins
3. It takes 5-60 sec to receive 2 fuel pips by watching 1 **passive** video ad which pops up when fuel pips drop below 6. Comparably, proactively watching 1 ad recieves only 1 fuel pip.
